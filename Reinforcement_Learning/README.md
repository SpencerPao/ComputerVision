# Experimenting with Reinforcement Learning Procedures
- Create & Train Reinforcement Learning Model
- Export Reinforcement Learning model for external games
- Prototype in Jupyer notebook
- Create Object Oriented Programming procedures for reinforcement learning

# Requirements
- Python version: >=3.6
- Run `make install` in this directory to install dependencies.

# Files
- *Selenium_Notebook_Test_URL_Requests.ipynb* is prototyping the Reinforcement learning algorithm (includes output and explanations); An object oriented framework will be coded soon.
