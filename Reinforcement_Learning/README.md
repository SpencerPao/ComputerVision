# Experimenting with Reinforcement Learning Procedures
- Create & Train Reinforcement Learning Model
- Export Reinforcement Learning model for external games
- Prototype in Jupyer notebook
- Create Object Oriented Programming procedures for reinforcement learning
- Explore running multiple browsers at once, feeding data inputs to same model for faster training procedure. (multiple instances training one model)

# Requirements
- Python version: >=3.6
- Run `make install` in this directory to install dependencies.
- run `pip install -e gym_environments`

# Medium post
Gym setup reference [here](https://www.novatec-gmbh.de/en/blog/creating-a-gym-environment/)


# Files
- `Selenium_Notebook_Test_URL_Requests.ipynb` is prototyping the Reinforcement learning algorithm (includes output and explanations); An object oriented framework will be coded soon.
