## Requirements
- Linux & Windows OS (Mac users might have to use a google collab notebook)
- run **pip install -r requirements.txt** in shell. (All models that exist in the framework -- note that might have errors when downloading due to compatiblity: would need to run non compatible packages last.)

# Files in current directory
- models.py is used when loading in pytorch model. (not required as of this moment)

## Real_Time_Test.py
- Use script once model has been trained.
- Runs trained model in the **Existing/Models/** folder
- run **python Real_Time_test.py** to see if trained model beats various obstacles and maybe even the game!

### Window Capture Folder
- Tools for taking a screen shot for the dinosaur game. I will be using this to store the appropriate PNG files into its associated folders (Jump, Duck).

### Dinosaur_Game_Data_Exploration.ipynb 
- Playing around with Windows OS and checking to see if functions work. 

# Future line of work:
- Reinforcement Learning
