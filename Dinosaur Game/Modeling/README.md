# Requirements
Choice of installation: _Note that everything is based on a windows machine_
- pip -r install Regular_requirements.txt 
- pip -r install Bayes_requirements.txt 

## Assumptions (Check out Dinosaur Game/Window_Capture):
- Dinosaur data has been populated and is ready to tune a model.
- Dinosaur Data Exploration + Model Development.ipynb explores the screenshot data. It also goes into depth on what aspects the canny edge detection have. The data obtained here comes from the numpy array generated by the main.py file located in Dinosaur Game / Window_Capture / Data. Note that you have to play the game on your local machine to generate said data.

## Modeling Efforts
- Training model on screenshot data
- Check out basic-models.ipynb -- Major thanks to Zorian for helping set up this notebook. You can check him out: [Zorian's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0oMmMPgGVqnDqNTyAIqTpw) and [Zorian's Github](https://zorian15.GitHub.io)
- basic-models.ipynb uses the cleaned data from Dinosaur Data Exploration + Model Development.ipynb to create a basic model (Logistic Regression)

# Notebooks 
- basic-models.ipynb : Logistic Model development.
- Dinosaur Data Exploration + Model Development.ipynb : Exploring what data snapshots look like (Used for calibration purposes -- need to edit main.py on transforms)
- XGBoost Bayes.ipynb : A general example on how to utilize bayesian applications with XGBoost (Notebook format)
- XGBoost_Dino_Game.ipynb : Native XGBoost model to use (fastest inference) -- only use for single use parameters, obtained from gridsearchCV
- pytorch-dino-game.ipynb : Neural network framework
- XGBoost_Dino_Game_Eval_Tune_Binary.ipynb : Used for binary outcomes (General notebook)
- XGBoost_Dino_Game_Eval_Tune_Grid_MultiClass.ipynb : Used for multi-class outcomes (General notebook)

# Scripts
- xgboost_bayesian_opt_binary.py: CPU / GPU compatible for training xgboost with bayesian optimization (Binary)
- xgboost_bayesian_opt_multiclass.py: CPU / GPU compatible for training xgboost with bayesian optimization (Multi-class)
- xgboost_single_dtrain.py : Similar to the XGBoost_Dino_Game_Eval_Tune_Binary.ipynb but in script format.
- xgboost_train.py : Similar to XGBoost_Dino_Game_Eval_Tune_Binary but has gridsearchCV in scikit-learn format (Long inference time)
