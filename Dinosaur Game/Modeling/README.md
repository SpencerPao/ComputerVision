# Train your Model!
- Logistic Regression (See basic-models.ipynb)
- Resnet18? (Some known computer vision model for transfer learning)

## Assumptions (Check out Dinosaur Game/Window_Capture):
- Dinosaur data has been populated and is ready to tune a model.
- Dinosaur Data Exploration + Model Development.ipynb explores the screenshot data. It also goes into depth on what aspects the canny edge detection have. The data obtained here comes from the numpy array generated by the main.py file located in Dinosaur Game / Window_Capture / Data. Note that you have to play the game on your local machine to generate said data.

## Modeling Efforts
- Training model on screenshot data
- Check out basic-models.ipynb -- Major thanks to Zorian for helping set up this notebook. You can check him out: [Zorian's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0oMmMPgGVqnDqNTyAIqTpw) and [Zorian's Github](https://zorian15.GitHub.io)
- basic-models.ipynb uses the cleaned data from Dinosaur Data Exploration + Model Development.ipynb to create a basic model (Logistic Regression)
